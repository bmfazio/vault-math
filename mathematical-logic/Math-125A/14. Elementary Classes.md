> We will now begin analyzing the notion of **satisfiability**, which will be central later on.
> Recall $\models_\mathcal M \varphi$ is the statement that we read as:
> - $\mathcal M$ satisfies $\varphi$ with (the assignment) $s$
> - $\varphi$ is true in $\mathcal M$ according to $s$
> - $\mathcal M$, $s$ model $\varphi$
> 
> The above statement must be interpreted in the context of some vocabulary $\tau$, a $\tau$-structure $\mathcal M$, a $\tau$-formula $\varphi$ and a variable assignment $s:\text{Var}\rightarrow M$.
> For example:
> 	- $\tau = \{{\color{red}e,\star}\}$
> 	- $\mathcal M = \{\mathbb Z; 0,+\}$ 
> 	- ${\color{red}\varphi} := {\color{red}\exists y(y\star y=x)}$
> 	- $s({\color{red}x})=2$, $s({\color{red}y})=-5$, etc.

> Recall the theorem in [[13. Interpretation of Formulas|lesson 13]], whereby the truth value of $\models_\mathcal M {\color{red}\varphi}[s]$ only depends on the values $s({\color{red}x})$ for $x\in \text{FV}({\color{red}\varphi})$. If $\color{red}\varphi$ is a [[sentence]], then $\models_\mathcal M {\color{red}\varphi}[s]$ does not depend on $s$ and can be written simply as $\models_\mathcal M {\color{red}\varphi}$, and we can just say "$\varphi$ is true in $\mathcal M$".
> 
> Note that formally we still need to apply the recursive definition of variable assignments (i.e. $\bar s$) to determine what the interpretation of $\varphi$ is, even when it is a sentence.

>We can extend the above notation to sets of formulas.
>**Definition.** If $\Gamma$ is a set, $\models_\mathcal M \Gamma[s]$ means "for all $\varphi \in \Gamma$, $\models_\mathcal M\varphi[s]$".

> Now for some examples of "formulas being satisfied":
> 
> A **group** is a structure $\mathcal K = (K;e,\otimes)$ in the vocabulary $\{e, \otimes\}$ where $e$ is a constant symbol and $\otimes$ is a binary function symbol, satisfying
> 1. **Associativity:** $\forall x,y,z(x\otimes(y\otimes z)=(x\otimes y)\otimes z)$
> 2. **Identity:** $\forall x(x\otimes e=x)$
> 3. **Inverse:** $\forall x(\exists y(x\otimes y = e))$
>
>A **linear ordering** is a structure $\mathcal K=(K;<_K)$ in the vocabulary $\{<\}$ where $<$ is a binary relation symbol, satisfying the following axioms:
>1. **Transitivity:** $\forall x,y,z((x<y \land y< z)\implies x < z)$
>2. **Antireflexivity:** $\forall x \neg(x<x)$
>3. **Antisymmetry:** $\forall x,y \neg(x<y \land y<x)$
>4. **Trichotomy:** $\forall x,y(x<y\lor y<x\lor x=y)$
>
>An **ordered field** is a structure $\mathcal K = (K;0_K,1_K,+_K,\times_K,<_K)$ in the vocabulary $\{\mathbf 0, \mathbf 1, \oplus, \otimes, \prec\}$ where
>- $\mathbf 0$, $\mathbf 1$ are constant symbols
>- $\oplus$, $\otimes$ are binary function symbols
>- $\prec$ is a binary relation symbol
>(11 axioms follow)

>In the context of **Peano arithmetic**, we have the axioms for a discrete semi-ring, but additionally we have an **induction axiom** for every formula $\varphi(x)$:
>$(\varphi(0)\land(\forall x(\varphi(x)\implies\varphi(x+1)))) \implies \forall x(\varphi(x))$
>
>Since there is an infinite number of formulas one can construct in the naturals, the above implies there is an infinite amount of axioms.

>We can regard first order logic as having two different types of applications: as in Peano arithmetic or ZFC, to develop the foundations of mathematics, and a more "algebraic" outlook where we consider particular structures and their properties.
>
>Next, we look at a general definition which tries to encapsulate all of the above examples.

>**Definition.** For a set of sentences $\Gamma$, let $\text{Mod}\Gamma$ be the class of all structures which model $\Gamma$.
>- For example, if $\Gamma$ contains exactly the axioms of groups, then $\text{Mod}\Gamma$ is the class of all groups.

>**Elementary class.** A class of structures $\mathfrak K$ is an elementary class if there exists a sentence $\varphi$ such that $\mathfrak K = \text{Mod}\varphi$.
>
>**Weakly elementary class.** A class of structures $\mathfrak K$ is a weakly elementary class if there exists **a set** of sentences $\Gamma$ such that $\mathfrak K = \text{Mod}\Gamma$.

> Whenever we have a finite set of sentences $\Gamma$, we can always join all of them with the logical conjunction to obtain a single sentence $\varphi$, and hence obtain an **elementary class**. Therefore, **weakly elementary classes** are those which cannot be reduce to a single sentence because they contain infinite many axioms, as in the case of the induction axioms in Peano arithmetic.

>**Example.** Consider the class of infinite groups. Define $\Gamma = \{\text{GrAx1}, \text{GrAx2}, \text{GrAx3}\}$, the set which contains the three group axioms, and $\Gamma' = \Gamma \cup \{\varphi_n:n\in\mathbb N\}$, the union with sentences which state that at least $n$ elements exist:
>$$\varphi_n = \exists x_1,\dots,x_n(x_1 \neq x_2\land x_2 \neq x_3 \land x_1 \neq x_3 \land \dots).$$
>Then, $\Gamma'$ corresponds to the axioms for infinite groups and they are a weakly elementary class.
