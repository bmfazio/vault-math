> We want to assign a truth value to each WFF. This will be done based on the truth values of the variables that appear in the formula.

> With a set $S$ of sentential variables, a **truth assignment** is a function $f : S \rightarrow \{T, F\}$.
> For example, let $S = \{A_1,A_2,A_3\}$; then the values below show one admissible truth assignment:
> 	- $f(A_1)=F$
> 	- $f(A_2)=T$ 
> 	- $f(A_3)=T$

> We can immediately formalize a more general definition. Starting with some truth assignment $f : S \rightarrow \{T, F\}$ and the set $\bar S$ of all WFFs that can be formed with elements of $S$, we can generate a new truth assignment $\bar f :\bar S \rightarrow \{T, F\}$ by applying recursion on the size of WFFs.
> 	- We start by setting $\bar f(\phi) = f(\phi)$ whenever $\phi$ is a sentential variable.
> 	- For any other WFF, we simply state the expected behavior of each connector.
