> We want to assign a truth value to each WFF. This will be done based on the truth values of the variables that appear in the formula.

> With a set $S$ of sentential variables, a **truth assignment** is a function $f : S \rightarrow \{T, F\}$.
> For example, let $S = \{A_1,A_2,A_3\}$. Then
> $f(A_1)=F$
> $f(A_2)=T$
> $f(A_3)=T$
