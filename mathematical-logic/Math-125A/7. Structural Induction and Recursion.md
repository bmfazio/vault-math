> Previously, when defining the set of all possible WFFs and the evaluation function, induction and recursion were invoked in an intuitive manner. A formal definition is now given.

> **Setting.** Let $U$ be a set, $B$ a subset of $U$ and $\mathcal F$ a set of operations on $U$.
> The goal is to define some set $C$ that represents all that can be generated by $\mathcal F$ starting from $B$. That set will be referred to as "the **closure** of $B$ under $\mathcal F$".

> Two definitions of $C$ will be given, each from a different perspective, and then their equivalence will be shown.
> **Top-down definition.** First, some additional terms are introduced:
> - A subset $S \subseteq U$ is called "closed under $\mathcal F$" iff $\forall f \in \mathcal F (\forall \bar s \in S^{<\omega}(f(\bar s)\in S))$.
> - A subset $S \subseteq U$ is called "inductive" if it's **closed** and $B \subseteq S$.
> 


> What is inductive?
