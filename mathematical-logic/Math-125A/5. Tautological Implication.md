> Let $\Sigma$ be a set of WFF and $\tau$ a single WFF. We say "$\Sigma$ tautologically implies $\tau$" if truth assignments that make all elements of $\Sigma$ true also make $\tau$ true.
> Notation: $\Sigma\models\tau$.

> If $\{\phi\}\models\psi$ and $\{\psi\}\models\phi$, we say that "$\phi$ is tautologically equivalent to $\psi$".
> Notation: $\sigma \models\!\mid \phi$.

Recommended exercise:
Verify some important tautological equivalences.
Associativity for $A \iff B \iff C$
