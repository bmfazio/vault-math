> **Theorem.** For every k-place boolean function $f:\{T,F\}^k \rightarrow \{T,F\}$, there is a WFF $\alpha$ on the variables $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k$ which only uses $\lor$ and $\neg$.

The video does not give a proper proof, but it shows an example that illustrates how this can be done in a recursive manner for a variety of WFFs

A proper proof does not seem to be given in the video. But here's one attempt:
- We can directly produce every 1- and 2-place boolean function and show their equivalence to some combination of connectives.
- Now assume we can already express k-place boolean functions with connectives. We can take the output of any k-place boolean function together with that of a 1-place boolean function to express any possible (k+1)-place boolean function and we know that we only need connectives for this as it is equivalent to constructing a 2-place boolean function.
- By induction, k-place boolean functions can be expressed with connectives for any k.
