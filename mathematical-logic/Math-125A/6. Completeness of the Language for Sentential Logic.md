> We want to determine whether the connectives defined so far are enough to express any relationship we might want to express between a tuple of truth values and an overall truth value.

> Begin by noticing that for any WFF, we can use the truth assignment rules previously defined to write out a truth table that shows truth values of the full expression for each possible combination of truth values of the component variables. In turn, we can use the resulting truth table to define a function that takes the truth values of the $k$ variables in $\alpha$ and returns a truth value in accordance to the constructed truth table.

> **Definition.** For a WFF $\alpha$, we say that $B_\alpha: \{T,F\}^k \rightarrow \{T,F\}$ is the "Boolean function associated with $\alpha$".
> **Observation 1.** Let $\alpha, \beta$ be two WFFs, then $\alpha \models\!\mid \beta \iff B_\alpha = B_\beta$.
> **Observation 2.** If $\alpha$ has an associated $B_\alpha = T$ i.e. constant truth, it is a tautology.

> Now we ask: does every k-place boolean function have an associated WFF?
> **Theorem.** For every k-place boolean function $f:\{T,F\}^k \rightarrow \{T,F\}$, there is a WFF $\alpha$ on the variables $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k$ for which $f=B_\alpha$ only uses $\lor$ and $\neg$.
> 
> **Proof.**
> Let $\alpha$ be a WFF such that $B_\alpha = f$.
> Replace each occurrence of $\phi \iff \psi$ with $(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\land(\psi\rightarrow\phi)$.
> Replace each occurrence of $\phi \rightarrow \psi$ with $\neg\phi\lor\psi$
> Replace each occurrence of $\phi\land\
> The language of sentential logic is **complete**.
