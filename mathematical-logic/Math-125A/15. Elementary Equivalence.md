> $A\equiv B$ aaa $A \not\equiv B$

> **Definition.** Two structures $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ are **elementary equivalent** (written $\mathcal M \equiv \mathcal N$) if every sentence $\varphi$ that is satisfied in one structure is also satisfied in the other, i.e.
> $$\models_\mathcal M \varphi \iff \models_\mathcal N \varphi$$
> Note that for this to make sense, both structures must use the same vocabulary.

> **Examples.** We can show that two structures are not elementary equivalent if we can find a sentence that is true in one but not in the other.
> - $(\mathbb N;0,+)\not\equiv(\mathbb Z;+,0)$
> $\models_{(\mathbb Z+0)}\forall x\exists y(x+y = 0)$
