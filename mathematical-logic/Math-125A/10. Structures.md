> Now that we know how to build WFFs in first order logic, the next step is to assign meaning to them.

> **Examples.** Consider the vocabulary $\tau = \{e,\star\}$ where $e$ is a constant symbol and $\star$ a binary function symbol.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Z:0,+)$? Yes ($x = -y$).
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb N:0,+)$? No.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Z:1,\times)$? No.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Q:1,\times)$? No ($0$ is the counterexample).

>**General case.** Consider a vocabulary $\tau =\{c_0,c_1,\dots,f_0,f_1,\dots,R_0,R_1,\dots\}$.
A $\tau$**-structure** is a tuple

> - $M$ is just a set that we call the **universe** or **domain** of $\mathcal M$,
> - the $a_i$ are elements of $M$ (no further properties; they will represent the constants),
> - for each $f_i$, the $g_i$ are functions $g_i:M^a \rightarrow M$ of same arity as $f_i$;
> - analogously, $H_i$ are relations $H_i \subseteq M^a$ of same arity as $R_i$.
> Essentially, a $\tau$-structure tells us one way of interpreting the formulas made from the $\tau$ vocabulary. For instance, the $f_i$ are just symbols but $g_i$ are actual functions which tell us what the symbol "does".
