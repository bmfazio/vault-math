> Now that we know how to build WFFs in first order logic, the next step is to assign meaning to them.

> **Examples.** Consider the vocabulary $\tau = \{e,\star\}$ where $e$ is a constant symbol and $\star$ a binary function symbol.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Z:0,+)$? Yes ($x = -y$).
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb N:0,+)$? No.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Z:1,\times)$? No.
> - Is $\forall x\exists y(y\star x=e)$ true in $(\mathbb Q:1,\times)$? No ($0$ is the counterexample).

>**General case.** Consider a vocabulary $\tau =\{c_0,c_1,\dots,f_0,f_1,\dots,R_0,R_1,\dots\}$.
