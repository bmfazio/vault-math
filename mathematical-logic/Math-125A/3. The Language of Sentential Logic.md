> Not as expressive as first order logic, but will serve as a warm up.

> The building blocks of SL are sentences; these have an associated truth value.

> We proceed by defining the components of the language:
> 	- Punctuation symbols: $(, )$
> 	- Connector symbols: $\neg, \land, \lor, \rightarrow, \iff$
> 	- Variable symbols: $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$

> Define an **expression** to be a string defined over a set of symbols. 
> Valid expressions in a given grammar are called **well-formed formulas (WFF)**.

> We will consider the following grammar:
> 	- Any variable symbol by itself is a WFF.
> 	- If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are WFF, so are $\neg \phi, (\phi \land \psi), (\phi \lor \psi), (\phi \rightarrow \psi), (\phi \iff \psi)$
