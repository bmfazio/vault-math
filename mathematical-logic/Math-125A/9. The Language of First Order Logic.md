 >First order logic is "strong enough" to develop **all of mathematics**. It is not much more complicated but much less restrictive (not at all?).

>Again, we will work with expressions (i.e. strings of symbols) that are built according to some rules.

>###### Symbols
>**Logical symbols**
>- equality: $=$.
>- connectives: $\land, \lor, \iff, \implies, \neg, \forall, \exists$.
>- variables: $v_0, v_1, v_2, \dots$ (we may use $x,y,z$ for convenience but consider them formally equivalent to some $v_n$).
>- punctuation: $(,)$.
>
>**Vocabulary**
>Some set $\{c_0,c_1,\dots,f_0,f_1,\dots,R_0,R_1,\dots\}$ which varies according to context.
>- For example, the vocabulary of groups requires an identity element, an operation symbol and a unit operation that return the inverse: $\{e,\star,^{-1}\}$.
