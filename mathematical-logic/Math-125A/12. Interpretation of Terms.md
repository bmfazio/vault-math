>In sentential logic, we only had connectives and variables. Not quantifiers or free variables. To determine the truth value of a WFF, one simply needed to know the truth values of the component variables and then apply the connectives.

Although [[3. The Language of Sentential Logic|lesson 3]] refers to the basic symbols in sentential logic as "variables", here he seems to refer to them as just "sentences" and says that sentential logic does not have actual variables.

> Now, we first need to assign values to free variables (i.e. elements from the relevant structure) before we can assign a truth value to the WFF.

> A **variable assignment** is a function $s:\text{Variables}\rightarrow M$ (domain of the structure $\mathcal M$). We wish to extend this to a function $\bar s:\text{Terms}\rightarrow M$. We do so by recursion:
> - $\bar s(v) = s(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.
> - $\bar s(c_i) = a_i$, where $c_i$ is a constant symbol and $a_i$ its interpretation.
> - $\bar s(f_i(t_1,\dots,t_k)) = g_i(\bar s(t_1), \dots, \bar s(t_k))$
