> Take the formula $\exists x(x\star x=y)$. In ($\mathbb Z: +$) this will be true when $y$ is even but not when it is odd, so we cannot directly assign a truth value to it.

>A **free variable** is a variable that is not bound to a quantifier. When a formula has no free variables we call it a **sentence**. For sentences, we can unambiguously assign a truth value.

>For a formal definition, let's first define a function $\text{var}:\text{Terms}\rightarrow\text{Variables}$:
>- If $v$ is a variable, $\text{var}(v)$
