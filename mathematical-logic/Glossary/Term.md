In the context of first order logic, terms are [[strings]] of symbols that represent elements.

The following are **terms**:
- All constant symbols $c_0, c_1, \dots$
- All variable symbols $v_0, v_1, \dots$
- Strings of the form $f_i(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ where $f_i$ is an $n$-ary function symbol and $t_1,\dots,t_n$ are terms.

As strings, terms can be formally considered to be tuples. There is a distinction between a symbol $s$ and the term constructed from that symbol, $\langle s\rangle$, however, we will almost always drop the tuple notation for convenience. 



Note that, being just collections of symbols, terms do not have any interpretation on their own.
