In the context of first order logic, terms are [[strings]] of symbols that represent elements.

The following are **terms**:
- All constant symbols $c_0, c_1, \dots$
- All variable symbols $v_0, v_1, \dots$
- Strings of the form $f_i(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ where $f_i$ is an $n$-ary function symbol and $t_1,\dots,t_n$ are terms.
