> Mathematical logic deals with the foundations of logic, formal systems and ultimately, for all of mathematics.
> 	- Solid foundations to avoid e.g. accepting definitions which may lead to paradoxes.
> 	- Formal systems allow us to study proofs/theorems/constructions themselves as mathematical objects.
> 	- Once formalized, can resort to computer verification/assistance for proofs.

> A proof is a mathematical argument that uses logical steps to show a mathematical statement follows from certain assumptions.
> 	- In order to express a proof, we need to have a common **language, rules and axioms**.

> Languages have two components.
> 	- Symbols: the set of allowed glyphs.
> 	- Grammar: the arrangements of symbols (i.e. tuples) which are considered valid.

> Rules specify
