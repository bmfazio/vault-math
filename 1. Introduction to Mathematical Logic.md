> Mathematical logic deals with the foundations of logic, formal systems and ultimately, for all of mathematics.
> 	- Solid foundations to avoid e.g. accepting definitions which may lead to paradoxes.
> 	- Formal systems allow us to study proofs/theorems/constructions themselves as mathematical objects.
> 	- Once formalized, can resort to computer verification/assistance for proofs.

> A proof is a mathematical argument that uses logical steps to show a mathematical statement follows from certain assumptions.
> 	- In order to express a proof, we need to have a common **language, rules and axioms**.

> Languages have two components.
> 	- Symbols: the set of allowed glyphs.
> 	- Grammar: the arrangements of symbols (i.e. tuples) which are considered valid.

> Rules specify the way in which the truth of a given statement relates to the truth of some other statement. This encodes the logic needed to prove some statement from a starting set of assumptions.

> Axioms are a collection of statements that describe the basic behavior of the objects we wish to work with (e.g. numbers, sets, functions). They are assumed to be true and hence the starting point for proofs.

> On completeness:
> 	- The language of a formal system is complete: any mathematical statement can be expressed with it.
> 	- The rules are complete too by GÃ¶del's Completeness theorem
